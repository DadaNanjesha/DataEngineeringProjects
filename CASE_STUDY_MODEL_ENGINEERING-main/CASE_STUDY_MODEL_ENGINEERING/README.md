# Credit Card Routing Project

## Task 1: Credit Card Routing for Online Purchase via Predictive Modelling

### Case Description
As a data scientist at one of the world's largest retail companies, you are tasked with addressing a high failure rate in online credit card payments. The current manual and rule-based routing logic for payment service providers (PSPs) is causing financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. The goal is to implement predictive modeling to automate credit card routing, aiming to increase payment success rates while minimizing transaction fees.

### Project Aim
Automate credit card routing using predictive modeling to enhance payment success rates and minimize transaction fees.

### Data Set
The dataset and relevant information, including PSP names and transaction fees, are provided in a separate *zip-folder: use_case_1.zip
PSP_Jan_Feb_2019.xlsx.

- tmsp: timestamp of transaction.
- country: country of transaction.
- amount: transaction amount.
- success: is 1 if payment is successful.
- PSP: name of payments service provider.
- 3D_secured: is 1 if customer is 3D identified (i.e. more secure online credit card payments).
- card: credit card provider (Master, Visa, Diners).

### Task Description

1. **Project Structuring and Git Repository Proposal**
   - Utilize CRISP-DM or Team DS methodologies to structure the project.
   - Provide a recommended structure for the Git repository. Note: Final code structure may vary.

2. **Data Set Quality Assessment**
   - Conduct initial data analysis.
   - Visualize findings for clear understanding by business stakeholders.

3. **Baseline and Predictive Models**
   - Develop a baseline model.
   - Create an accurate predictive model that meets business requirements.
  
4. **Feature Importance and Model Interpretability**
   - Discuss the importance of individual features in the model.
   - Make model results interpretable for business stakeholders.
   - Conduct a sophisticated error analysis to highlight drawbacks.

5. **Model Implementation Proposal**
   - Propose how the model can be used by the business in everyday work.
   - Explore options such as a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

6. **Documentation Submission**
   - Attach the code to the final submission document.
